## Problem

### Student Performance Tracker

A university system stores student roll numbers as `int` but requires explicit casting to `short` for certain operations.
It also tracks whether a student has passed or failed using a `boolean` variable.

 **Expected Output:** 
If stored and printed correctly, your output should look something like:

```
Student Roll Number (Int): 12345  
Converted Roll Number (Short): 12345  
Has Passed: true  

```

Run the code, modify values, and test different student records!

```java
class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declare and assign student roll number as int
        int rollNumber = 12_345;  // Roll number within short range

        // Explicitly convert int to short
        short convertedRollNumber = (short) rollNumber;

        // Declare and assign student pass status
        boolean hasPassed = true;  // True if the student has passed, false otherwise

        // Print all values
        
        
        System.out.println("Student Roll Number (Int): " + rollNumber);
        System.out.println("Converted Roll Number (Short): " + convertedRollNumber);
        System.out.println("Has Passed: " + hasPassed);
        
        
    }
}
```
